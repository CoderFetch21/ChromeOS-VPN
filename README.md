# ChromeOS-VPN
This is a simple VPN for ChromeOS and ChromeOS Flex to install this you will need a few things.

1. You need linux terminal beta enabled (for older computers that don't support it I managed to bypass by turning on legacy boot support and if that doesn't work try putting it first on boot priority)

2. You will need chromeos autostart repository (https://github.com/supechicken/ChromeOS-AutoStart)

3. You will need to turn on developer mode for extensions

4. You will finally need this github repository
